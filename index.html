        <h1>The content of the site and how it is organized:</h1>
        <p>There will be a navigationbar at the top of each page with an overview of all the pages, and make it easy for the user to navigate between the pages.

There will be a logo at the top of the navigationbar.</p>
        <p>The website will include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A home-page with general information (name, breed, habits), and a picture of our clients dog.</li>
            <li>A page with a picture- and video-gallery of our clients dog.</li>
            <li>A page with a program that will calculate the age of the pet, and convert this age between human years and dog years.</li>
            <li>A page with information about the dog breed.</li>
            <li>A page with the dogs diet plan and food habits.</li>
            <li>A contact-us page where the user can add their name, email-address and a message in a form.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There will be a footer at the bottom of each page including the logo, the name of the developers of the website, a link to a facebook-group about the dog breed and a link to our contact-us form.</p>
