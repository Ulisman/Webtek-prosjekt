                <li>All the videos on the website should have browser support. This means that visitors with browsers that do not support a certain video format should be served a video with another format instead. The file formats must be supported by the video element</li>
                <li>The visual experience should be exciting. There should be a few different different colors on the website, but not too many</li>
                <li>Functional: The website should have at least one sub-page</li>
                <li>Functional: The client wanted the website and the url to be the same for all devices. This means we will create a single responsive website instead of having dedicated versions</li>
