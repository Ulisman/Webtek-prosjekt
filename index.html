            own ability to create functionality on website for our client.

            <ul>
                <li>Non-functional/functional?: All the videos on the website should have browser support.

                <li>Non-functional: The visual experience should be exciting. There should be a few different different colors on the website, but not too many</li>
                <li>Functional: The website should have at least one sub-page</li>
                <li>Functional: The client wanted the website and the url to be the same for all devices. This means we will create a single responsive website instead of having dedicated versions</li>
