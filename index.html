            Our proposed purpose of the site is the display and propogate the likeness of 
            clients pet animal. We aim to do so through the display of various visual media 
            as well as sharing interesting content that might appeal to dog-interested people. 
            This may be through a human years to dog years calculator, videoes, dietary plan and live age display.
