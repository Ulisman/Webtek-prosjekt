            <h2>The changes we made (and how)</h2>
            <p>Changes to index.html: We changed where clicking on the image of Nala takes the user. Insted of taking the the user to gallery.html, the user gets sent to the content section at the bottom of the homepage, where they can get an overview of the website's content. We did this by having the value of the "href" attribute set as the ID of the content-section-element. Presicely "href='#contentContainer' "</p>
            <p>Changes to contact.html: We added javascript functionality to the FAQ section. While it was intended in P2 that the FAQ elements would have a dropdown feature, it was not intended that this feeature would be created with javascript. However, we decided to use javascript to reduce the amount of code needed to add new questions. Instead of needing to write a new div element and the corresponding children elements to that div for each FAQ question, you simply only have to add the question text and awnser text to the "faqContent" object in content.js</p>
            <p>Changes to gallery.html: We added slidershow and showcase for when a picture or video is clicked as intended. But we added some extra features. When a video is clicked, it will autostart the video. If wanting to add more picture is requested, it would be easy to add a picture, by just adding the picture in the images folder with the right name and edit one variable on the slideshow.js file that defines how many pictures is in the gallery. There is also an compatability feature were the videos is algined vertically if nessesary. </p>
