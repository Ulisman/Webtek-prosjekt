            <h2>3. Purpose, goals and audience</h2>
            <p>
                The website's purpose is to propagate the likeness of the clients pet animal, and provide information about the breed of the animal and the species of animal in general. We aim to do so through various visual and interactive content. Such as an age calculator, information about diets, a Nala image-and-video-gallery etc. The websites main audience will be those who are interested in the dog species, and in particular the Griffon Bruxellois breed, and want to learn more about these topics This might be people who are considering buying a dog of this breed, people who already have a dog but want to learn more about dogs or people who work with dogs, like for instance veterinarians.

            <h2>4. Navigation structure</h2>
            <p>
                The navigation structure of our clients websites may be described as simple, and it's shown in Figure 1.
                It is possible to get access to every page from every page in the website. It should all be visible
                through the navigation bar at the top of every page.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our reason for choosing this kind of structure is to give the user full freedom within the website to
                access every page. This will make the website less complicated and understandable for children.
            </p>

            <h4>The styling that are specified below will be applied for all the pages on our website:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Fonts:</b>
                    We have chosen Roboto as our default font. 1.2em for the body font, 3em for the main titles and
                    1.6em for the text in the navbar. We will also have backup-fonts for browsers that do not support
                    our main fonts.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Color scheme:</b>
                    The color scheme consists of “calm” colors. The body background will be beige (EFE2BA), the footer
                    will have a dark blue background (4056A1), and the menu elements will have a lighter blue background
                    (AFB7FF). The design team decided to change to this color scheme instead of having a “exciting
                    visual experience” which we said in P1. The text color will mostly be black, and the body text will
                    be inside boxes with white background color.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Body width:</b>
                    100%;
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Navbar position:</b>
                    Since we want to make it easy for the users to navigate the website, we will have a navbar that is
                    always available and visible at the top of the screen. Hence, the navbar will have a fixed position
                    on the screen and contain informative keywords that link to the other sub-pages. Our client wanted
                    there to be one or multiple dog-logos in the website, so we added a dog-logo to the top of the
                    website in the navbar, and a dog-logo in the footer
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Footer:</b>
                    Every page will have the same footer. The footer will not have a fixed position to the screen, so it
                    will only appear when the user is at the bottom of the page. It will include our logo, who the
                    website is made by and also a link to a facebook group for dog owners.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Logo:</b>
                    Our logo is a drawing of a dog that is meant to look like the griffon bruxellois breed. The logo
                    will be located left on the navbar next to the menu buttons. The logo will also as mentioned before
                    be on the left side in the footer.
                </li>

            <h2>6. Content</h2>
            <p>There will be six separate pages as follows:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    index.html
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            This is the homepage and will appear when users visit the website. The homepage will provide a brief overview about the functionalities of the website and information about how old Nala is. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If the user click the main image of Nala on the website, then the user will be redirected to a photo gallery of Nala.

                            This page will include an in depth view on Nala's diet. The page will have information about what Nala eats in a day, the amount and when she eats. The page will also include information and some basic diet tips for dogs, for example different food types that can be toxic for dogs. We will also create a calculator where the user can write the age, size and activity levels of their own dog, to get a customized diet plan for them.

                            This page aims to describe common traits and info about the dog breed through both visual and textual content. A visual representation of statistics will be used for people who contemplate getting their own dog of the same breed. This coupled with text concerning the clients own experience with the dog breed compared to other breeds they have encountered. The page will include fun vector dog images to appeal to the younger demographic. The progress bars that represent the different traits of the dog breed will also be animated upon opening the page.

                            The video on the gallery page will be displayed with a 410px width and 320px height. It will not automatically start playing because this is not a supported feature on all browsers. Under the video element there will be an automatic   slideshow-gallery showing 3 images at a time. These images will have a width of 200 px and a height of 185 px.

                            This page will provide information for users who want to contact us, including our email address. This will mainly be done also using a form-field where users can ask questions about the website and Nala. This will consist of an input field where users will be asked to enter their email address (because the response is intended to be sent to their email), and another input field where the users will ask their question. This page will also provide answers to some general and frequently asked questions (FAQ).

                        <li>
                            As a proof of concept we decided to create a sample for what the website might look like on a phone. One concern was the navigation bar and how we might maintain a good overview over accessible pages. We compressed the navigation bar to only be visible when clicking the icon in the top right corner. This would lower a large list containing the various pages whilst covering the current page the user is currently connected to. In the mobile version, a lot of the context of the page has to go on top of each other rather than visualizing everything on the screen at once.

                    Ulrik will be in charge of creating a javascript function on the homepage that will provide exactly how old nala is, to the second. This function will update every second, with the help of the date object and the setInterval method in javascript.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Jakob will be in charge of the diet calculator which we plan to implement with javascript on the diet page. The user will be able to input the age, dog size and activity  levels and the function will generate and display a customized diet plan based on the input from the user. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sondre will be creating a javascript function that will dynamically display images and videos of Nala in a slideshow. Furthermore, when an image or a video is clicked on, it will resize and become bigger so that it is more visible to the user. The images will be 200 x 185px, and when clicked on they will cover around 70% x 70% of the page. The videos will have at default have a width and height of 410 x 320 px, and when clicked on they will cover around 70% x 70% of the page
                </li>
                <li>
                    Julian will be in charge of creating a javascript function for calculating a dog's age in “human years“ based on the following parameters: how many “dog years” the dog has lived, how many months old it is and what size the dog is (small, medium, large). The calculator will use a regression based formula for computing the output. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Billy will be in charge of creating a javascript function that sends a response when the user has submitted a question in the form field on the contact page. This response is implemented because it is important to provide feedback / inform the user of what is happening. The response will be a text box stating if the form was successfully submitted or not.
