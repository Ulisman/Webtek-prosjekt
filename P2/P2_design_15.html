            <h2>4. Navigation structure</h2>
            <p>
                The navigation structure of our clients websites may be described as simple, and it's shown in Figure 1. It is possible to get access to every page from every page in the website. It should all be visible through the navigation bar at the top of every page. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Our reason for choosing this kind of structure is to give the user full freedom within the website to access every page. This will make the website less complicated and understandable for children.

            <h4>The styling that are specified below will be applied for all the pages on our website:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Fonts:</b>
                    We have chosen Roboto as our default font. 1.2em for the body font, 3em for the main titles and 1.6em for the text in the navbar. We will also have backup-fonts for browsers that do not support our main fonts. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Color scheme:</b>
                    The color scheme consists of “calm” colors. The body background will be beige (EFE2BA), the footer will have a dark blue background (4056A1), and the menu elements will have a lighter blue background (AFB7FF). The design team decided to change to this color scheme instead of having a “exciting visual experience” which we said in P1. The text color will mostly be black, and the body text will be inside boxes with white background color.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Body width:</b>
                    100%; 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Navbar position:</b>
                    Since we want to make it easy for the users to navigate the website, we will have a navbar that is always available and visible at the top of the screen. Hence, the navbar will have a fixed position on the screen and contain informative keywords that link to the other sub-pages. Our client wanted there to be one or multiple dog-logos in the website, so we added a dog-logo to the top of the website in the navbar, and a dog-logo in the footer
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Footer:</b>
                    Every page will have the same footer. The footer will not have a fixed position to the screen, so it will only appear when the user is at the bottom of the page. It will include our logo, who the website is made by and also a link to a facebook group for dog owners.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Logo:</b>
                    Our logo is a drawing of a dog that is meant to look like the griffon bruxellois breed. The logo will be located left on the navbar next to the menu buttons. The logo will also as mentioned before be on the left side in the footer.
                </li>
            </ul>
