            <h2>4. Navigation structure</h2>
            <p>
                The navigation structure of our clients websites may be described as simple, and it's shown in Figure 1. It is possible to get access to every page from every page in the website. It should all be visible through the navigation bar at the top of every page. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Our reason for choosing this kind of structure is to give the user full freedom within the website to access every page. This will make the website less complicated and understandable for children. 
            </p>

            <h4>The styling that are specified below will be applied for all the pages on our website:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Fonts:</b>
                    We have chosen Roboto as our default font. 1.2em for the body font, 3em for the main titles and 1.6em for the text in the navbar. We will also have backup-fonts for browsers that do not support our main fonts. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Color scheme:</b>
                    The color scheme consists of “calm” colors. The body background will be beige (EFE2BA), the footer will have a dark blue background (4056A1), and the menu elements will have a lighter blue background (AFB7FF). The design team decided to change to this color scheme instead of having a “exciting visual experience” which we said in P1. The text color will mostly be black, and the body text will be inside boxes with white background color.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Body width:</b>
                    100%; 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Navbar position:</b>
                    Since we want to make it easy for the users to navigate the website, we will have a navbar that is always available and visible at the top of the screen. Hence, the navbar will have a fixed position on the screen and contain informative keywords that link to the other sub-pages. Our client wanted there to be one or multiple dog-logos in the website, so we added a dog-logo to the top of the website in the navbar, and a dog-logo in the footer
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Footer:</b>
                    Every page will have the same footer. The footer will not have a fixed position to the screen, so it will only appear when the user is at the bottom of the page. It will include our logo, who the website is made by and also a link to a facebook group for dog owners.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Logo:</b>
                    Our logo is a drawing of a dog that is meant to look like the griffon bruxellois breed. The logo will be located left on the navbar next to the menu buttons. The logo will also as mentioned before be on the left side in the footer.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>6. Content</h2>
            <p>There will be six separate pages as follows:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    index.html
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            This is the homepage and will appear when users visit the website. The homepage will provide a brief overview about the functionalities of the website and information about how old Nala is. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If the user click the main image of Nala on the website, then the user will be redirected to a photo gallery of Nala.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    diet.html
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            This page will include an in depth view on Nala's diet. The page will have information about what Nala eats in a day, the amount and when she eats. The page will also include information and some basic diet tips for dogs, for example different food types that can be toxic for dogs. We will also create a calculator where the user can write the age, size and activity levels of their own dog, to get a customized diet plan for them. 
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    breed.html
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            This page aims to describe common traits and info about the dog breed through both visual and textual content. A visual representation of statistics will be used for people who contemplate getting their own dog of the same breed. This coupled with text concerning the clients own experience with the dog breed compared to other breeds they have encountered. The page will include fun vector dog images to appeal to the younger demographic. The progress bars that represent the different traits of the dog breed will also be animated upon opening the page.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            On this page a collage of images and videos will be presented with the aim of being appealing and easy to view. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The video on the gallery page will be displayed with a 410px width and 320px height. It will not automatically start playing because this is not a supported feature on all browsers. Under the video element there will be an automatic   slideshow-gallery showing 3 images at a time. These images will have a width of 200 px and a height of 185 px.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            This page will inform the user about the correct way to calculate dog years to human years. This page will also include the age calculator converting dog years to human years, depending on the size and human years, either entered in months or years.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                            This page will provide information for users who want to contact us, including our email address. This will mainly be done also using a form-field where users can ask questions about the website and Nala. This will consist of an input field where users will be asked to enter their email address (because the response is intended to be sent to their email), and another input field where the users will ask their question. This page will also provide answers to some general and frequently asked questions (FAQ).

                    Mobile concept
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            As a proof of concept we decided to create a sample for what the website might look like on a phone. One concern was the navigation bar and how we might maintain a good overview over accessible pages. We compressed the navigation bar to only be visible when clicking the icon in the top right corner. This would lower a large list containing the various pages whilst covering the current page the user is currently connected to. In the mobile version, a lot of the context of the page has to go on top of each other rather than visualizing everything on the screen at once.
