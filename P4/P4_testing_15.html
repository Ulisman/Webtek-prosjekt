            <h2>3. Testing document:</h2>
            <p>We split the questions of the testing form into two sections. The first section consisted of “treasure hunt” questions. The purpose of these questions were to find out how difficult/easy it was for the tester to navigate through the website to find what the question asked for. The second section consisted of questions about the performance and user experience of the website.

            <h2>4. Tester audience:</h2>
            <p>
                When we asked people to test our website, we tried to find people who fitted into the audience we described in P2. Everyone we tested either owns a dog/dogs or are interested in dogs. Therefore, many used the calculators for their own dog which made the testing more realistic. We also said that our main audience was children who love dogs. In the testing phase we managed to test 3 children, which was a little less than we hoped for. But considering we didn't know so many children, we are happy with the outcome. The total test audience had an average age of 22 years old. 18% were IT-consultants, 27% college students, 27% were students (pre-university), 18% adults (over 25) and 10% other. We also managed to do live testing with 8 out of the 11 people we tested the website with. Therefore we got more detailed and precise answers, and could also see how the testers navigated on the website.

            <h2>5. Testing platforms:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Chrome:</b> We designed the website specifically for Google Chrome since this was specified in the P3 project description. However, the goal was also to make the website compatible for other browsers as well, such as Safari, Microsoft Edge and Firefox. For example we did this with the gallery, where we have multiple video formats depending on what browser the user is using.</li>
                <li><b>Safari:</b> The testers that used Safari had no issues, and the website ran just as smooth as it would on chrome. </li>
                <li><b>Mobile:</b> On the mobile version of the website we experienced a few issues regarding the navbar of the website. Several testers thought it was unnecessarily complicated just to navigate to the home page. We fixed these problems as described in point 7 (response).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Feedback summary:</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Design:</b> The testers were pleased with the design of the website. The simple and minimalistic style of the website was appealing and mentioned several times in the feedback from testers. Although, the website design was of course not perfect, and some clients felt that the color scheme was not for them. Another criticism on the design was that some of the sub-pages did not have the content centered enough.
            </p>
            <p> 
                <b>Navigation:</b> The navigation aspect of the website was very successful according to the testing and feedback. All the testers successfully answered the “treasure hunt” questions with ease, which proved that they could navigate through the website at a sufficient level. 
            </p> 
            <p> 
                <b>Content:</b> The content was useful based on the feedback of the testers. The general sentiment from the feedback was that the functionalities of the website, calculators in particular, were useful for dog owners and people who were interested in dogs (which was the intention). 
            </p> 
            <p>  
                <b>Usability:</b> Større knapper, hoppet på forsiden/forsidebilde -  Some of the testers felt that bigger buttons, especially in the navbar, would make it easier to use the website. Other than that the general consensus was that it was quite easy to use the website
            </p>
            </section>
        <section>
            <h2>7. Your response:</h2>
            <p>
                We decided to do some small changes based on the feedback we got. We made the logo into a link to the homepage, we also made the text on the mobile menu into a link to the homepage. This change was based on the fact that mobile users couldn't get back to the home page with one click. Additionally, we centered some elements in the contact form and age-calculator, after some feedback on that the page looked a bit messy and uncentered. We also changed the navbar background back to darker beige color (EFE2BA), to make it stand out more after some negative comments on this. This created a clearer contrast between the nav bar and the page’s content. We found that giving a greater contrast helps to highlight its importance and role on the website, as it is the main navigation tool throughout the pages. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, we could also have done more changes to the website if we had the time. As mentioned, some were unhappy with the color scheme on the website, so this is something we could have looked more into and possibly changed. We could also have increased the size of the navbar buttons, after many said that they were too small. Except for the color scheme, all of the feedback we got was all easily fixable. 
            </p>

            <h2>8. Self-reflection:</h2>
            <p>
                Throughout this project we all developed our technical ability immensely, each member in their own way. However, one skill we all grew throughout the project was the way in which we worked in a group alongside each other with varying levels of expertise. Being able to step into leader roles when we catch each other falling behind with the focus on making a good product really developed our team work throughout the project. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We also experienced that everything took a lot more time than we expected. In the planning phase a lot more details of the whole website had to be fleshed out then we first expected. This led to some discussions in the group and we had to dedicate time to agree among ourselves. As the project started wrapping up, we hit a point in which we thought we had finished with coding the website. However, when we started nitpicking details we often came across bugs, errors and problems that had to be changed. We definitely didn’t allocate enough time for this phase in our first plan. For future projects we therefore need to take this into account when deciding deadlines, so we always have some extra time for unexpected issues. Throughout the project we all learned how to work more effectively as a team and how to use crucial development tools such as Figma and Git as an advantage in our work. These are skills that are incredibly useful in an actual work environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                The testing part of the project was also very useful. Firstly, it gave us a lot of technical feedback, which we could use to improve the website and to adapt changes that we were not previously aware of. Secondly, the testing allowed us to see how you could interact with the website from the perspective of someone who is not a developer on the website. Furthering this skill was important to us as we found that developers can often tunnel in on usability and functions of the website rather than seeing it from a common-use, holistic perspective.
