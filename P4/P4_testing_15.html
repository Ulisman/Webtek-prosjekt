            <h2>3. Testing document:</h2>
            <p>We split the questions of the testing form into two sections. The first section consisted of “treasure hunt” questions. The purpose of these questions were to find out how difficult/easy it was for the tester to navigate through the website to find what the question asked for. The second section consisted of questions about the performance and user experience of the website.

            <h2>4. Tester audience:</h2>
            <p>When we asked people to test our website, we tried to find 
                people who fitted into the audience we described in P2. 
                Everyone we tested either owns a dog/dogs or is interested 
                in dogs. Therefore many used the calculators for their own 
                dog which made the testing more realistic. We also said that 
                our main audience was children who love dogs. In the testing 
                phase we managed to test 3 children, which was a little less 
                than we hoped for. But considering we didn't know so many 
                children, we are happy with the outcome. The total test 
                audience had an average age of 22 years old. 14.2% were 
                it-consultants, 21.4% college students, 14.2% were students, 
                … . We also managed to do live testing with 10 out of the 15 
                people we tested the website with. Therefore we got more detailed 
                precise answers and could see how the testers used the website.</p>

            <h2>5. Testing platforms:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Chrome:</b> We designed the website specifically for Google Chrome since this was specified in the P3 project description. However, the goal was also to make the website compatible for other browsers as well, such as Safari, Microsoft Edge and Firefox. For example we did this with the gallery, where we have multiple video formats depending on what browser the user is using.</li>
                <li><b>Safari:</b> The testers that used Safari had no issues, and the website ran just as smooth as it would on chrome. </li>
                <li><b>Mobile:</b> On the mobile version of the website we experienced a few issues regarding the navbar of the website. Several testers thought it was unnecessarily complicated just to navigate to the home page. We fixed these problems as described in point 7 (response).</li>

            <h2>6. Feedback summary:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Design:</b> The testers were pleased with the design of the website. The simple and minimalistic style of the website was appealing and mentioned several times in the feedback from testers. Although, the website design was of course not perfect, and some clients felt that the color scheme was not for them. Another criticism on the design was that some of the sub-pages did not have the content centered enough. </li>
                <li><b>Navigation:</b> The navigation aspect of the website was very successful according to the testing and feedback. All the testers successfully answered the “treasure hunt” questions with ease, which proved that they could navigate through the website at a sufficient level.  </li>
                <li><b>Content:</b> The content was useful based on the feedback of the testers. The general sentiment from the feedback was that the functionalities of the website, calculators in particular, were useful for dog owners and people who were interested in dogs (which was the intention). </li>
                <li><b>Usability:</b> Større knapper, hoppet på forsiden/forsidebilde -  Some of the testers felt that bigger buttons, especially in the navbar, would make it easier to use the website. Other than that the general consensus was that it was quite easy to use the website</li>
            </ul>

        <section>
            <h2>7. Your response:</h2>
            <p>We decided to do some small changes based on the feedback we got. We made the logo into a link to the homepage, we also made the text on the mobile menu into a link to the homepage. This change was based on feedback that the mobile users couldn't get back to the home page with one click. Additionally, we centered some elements in the contact form and age-calculator, after some feedback on that the page looked a bit messy in some places.</p>

            <h2>8. Self-reflection:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Throughout this project we all developed our technical ability immensely, each member in their own way. However, one skill we all grew throughout the project was the way in which we worked in a group alongside each other with varying levels of expertise. Being able to step into leader roles when we catch each other lacing was</li>
                <li>This was of course a natural progression as the group had different responsibilities</li>
                <li>Throughout the project we all learned how to work more effectively as a team and how to use tools such as Figma and Git as an advantage.</li>
                <li>We also experienced that everything took a lot more time than we expected. In the planning phase almost every detail of the whole website had to be planned. This led to some discussions and we had to dedicate a lot more time to this than we first planned. Also when we thought we were finished with coding the website, it constantly came up bugs, errors and problems that had to be changed. For future projects we therefore need to take this into account when deciding deadlines, so we always have some extra time if </li>
